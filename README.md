WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT YET DONE!

inkwave is a command-line utility for converting `.wbf` to `.wrf` files and displaying meta-data information from `.wbf` files in a human readable format.

`.wbf` is the format stored on the flash chip present on the ribbon cable of some electronic paper displays made by the E Ink Corporation and `.wrf` is the input format used by the i.MX 508 EPDC (electronic paper display controller).
